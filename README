This is the code for computing the twin-width of graphs.

We used Python 3.8, PySAT 1.6.0 and networkx 2.5

The project can be run by using:
python runner.py <path-to-instance-in-dimacs-format>

The project contains the following files, except the runner:
encoding.py - Contains the relative encoding
encoding2.py - Contains the absolute encoding (using this encoding requires changing the comments in runner.py)
heuristic.py - Contains the code to compute the upper bound
preprocessing.py - Contains the only preprocessing we do - twin merge
tools.py - This file contains many helper functions, including module computation, consistency checks and code
to generate some named graphs.

The folder bin contains the nauty binary.
The folder experiments contains the code to run different experiments and extract the results, as well as the instances.
